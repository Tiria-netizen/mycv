<h2>Pesonal Experience</h2>
<p> My academic journey has been nothing short of an adventure—starting from the legendary halls of Kibagare Primary School (2007-2014), where I mastered the fine art of 
last-minute cramming and secured my KCPE certificate.
I then ascended to the battlefield of Escarpment High School (2014-2018), where I faced the academic gladiator arena known as KCSE and emerged victorious with a certificate in hand. 
Now, I find myself at Kisii University (2023-Present), pursuing a degree in Applied Computer Science, diving deep into the world of algorithms, debugging nightmares, and the eternal question:
‘Why is my code not working?’ Each step of the way has shaped me into the tech enthusiast I am today, equipped with knowledge, resilience, and a well-earned caffeine addiction.</p>
